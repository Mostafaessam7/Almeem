# Almeem Fashion - E-Commerce Store with ASP.NET Core and Angular

### Welcome to the **Almeem Fashion** repository! This project demonstrates how to build a full-featured e-commerce store from scratch using ASP.NET Core for the backend and Angular for the front end. This application is structured for real-world application development, covering everything from the initial setup to cloud deployment.

## Project Overview

### Almeem Fashion is a proof-of-concept e-commerce application that brings together key components of an online store. Built with a layered architecture, the project separates the client, server, and data access logic for clear organization and scalability. By following best practices in both ASP.NET Core and Angular, this project serves as an excellent reference for developers looking to create robust, scalable web applications.

## Key Components

### 1. Frontend (Angular)
The Angular application is the storeâ€™s client-facing side, where users can:
- Browse products, view details, and manage their shopping basket.
- Use a responsive UI built with Angular Material and Tailwind CSS.
- Benefit from lazy-loaded routes and modular architecture, improving performance and usability.

### 2. Backend (ASP.NET Core API)
The backend API is built with ASP.NET Core, providing:
- RESTful endpoints for managing product data, orders, and user authentication.
- Patterns like Repository, Unit of Work, and Specification to keep the code maintainable and testable.
- ASP.NET Identity for user login and registration, with role-based access control.
- Redis for efficient shopping basket storage and caching.
- Stripe integration to handle secure payments with 3D Secure support.

### 3. Admin Dashboard (ASP.NET Core MVC)
The Admin Dashboard provides administrators with tools for managing the store:
- Add and update products, manage categories, and view orders.
- Implemented as a separate MVC application for secure, role-based access to admin functionalities.
- Allows admins to oversee inventory and handle order management.

### 4. Real-Time Updates (SignalR)
SignalR is used to provide real-time updates, such as order status changes, creating a more interactive experience for users and administrators.

### 5. Deployment and Hosting
Instructions are provided for publishing Almeem Fashion to Azure, enabling smooth transition from development to production. Hosting the app on Azure allows for scalable and reliable access for users.
